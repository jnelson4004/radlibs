## Description
Our RadLib generator is platform where you can create fun fill-in-the-blank word games from a variety of different stories. The website provides users with a short story or paragraph with certain words removed so that the user can input their own nouns, verbs, and adjectives to complete the story. Once the blanks are filled the user can hit the generate button to read the masterpiece they've created! Here is a reference where we had our inspiration from. https://www.madlibs.com/
