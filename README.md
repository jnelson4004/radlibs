## Description
Our RadLib generator is platform where you can create fun fill-in-the-blank word games from a variety of different stories. The website provides users with a short story or paragraph with certain words removed so that the user can input their own nouns, verbs, and adjectives to complete the story. Once the blanks are filled the user can hit the generate button to read the masterpiece they've created! Here is a reference where we had our inspiration from. (https://www.madlibs.com/)

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
The following image shows the web application's appearance. You can also go to the web application by clicking the following link. https://chelleyoungw.github.io/INSERT-REPO-NAME-HERE/

## Project status
Our project is still a work in progress and will be updated as soon as possible. We run into struggles like being able to deploy our project onto Heroku, getting the nouns, verbs, and adjectives to correspond to our blanks within our Radlib stories.
